# Contributing

Feel free to contribute in the form of bug reports or feature requests.
Use Github's [issue](https://github.com/philzon/helm-assert/issues) system to create and detail them.

Since the project's design is not finalized, or until a stable, major release has been performed, anything added could be changed or removed later on without further notice.
